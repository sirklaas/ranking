## DISCOVERED TASKS

*Tasks discovered during development will be added here*

## BLOCKED/ISSUES

*Current blockers and issues will be tracked here*

## COMPLETED MILESTONES

### Foundation Documents
- âœ… **2025-07-24**: Created PLANNING.md, PRD.md, and TASKS.md
- âœ… **2025-07-24**: Established project vision and requirements

## NEXT PRIORITY TASK

**Initialize Next.js 14+ project with TypeScript**
- Set up the basic Next.js project structure
- Configure TypeScript with strict mode
- Install and configure essential dependencies
- Set up the three-screen page structure (presenter, player, display)

## DEVELOPMENT NOTES

### Key Decisions Made
- Three-screen architecture confirmed
- PocketBase chosen for real-time backend
- Highcharts selected for visualizations
- Mobile-first responsive design approach
- Single game session model (no pause/resume)

### Technical Considerations
- Real-time synchronization is critical for user experience
- Mobile optimization essential for player interface
- Large display optimization needed for TV/beamer
- Network resilience important for venue WiFi
- Performance optimization required for 100+ users

### User Experience Priorities
1. Presenter ease of use (non-technical users)
2. Player simplicity (minimal cognitive load)
3. Engaging visualizations (audience retention)
4. Real-time feedback (immediate gratification)
5. Reliable performance (professional presentation)
